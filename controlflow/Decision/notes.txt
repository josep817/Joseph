DECISION CONTRAL FLOW STATEMENT
> The execution of a block of statement under the if header depends on evaluation of a
conditional statement of which if it is True , the statement under it is executed 
oif False the default condition is evaluated under which the statement gets executed .
>They include :
i) if statement 
ii)if ...else statement 
iii) if ...elif..else statements
iv) Nested if statement 
v) Ternary statement 
vi)Match statement 

i) if statements
    if condition:
        inside block 

    outside outside

> In oder for the inside block to be executed the outside block must be true
> F the condition is False the inside block is skipped and outside block is executed. 
>Execution of block statement depend upon evaluation of the statement. 
> The inside block is indented hence part of if block/statement
>The inside must be followed by full colon



ii) if ...else statement 
>It has two option in that the situation the condition statement in the 
   if header block is false ,the else part is evaluated and the statement under it is executed.

if condition:
    block of statement

else:
   block statement 

In order for a statement to belong to either if block or else block ,it has to be indented 
 inside it 
> The indentation is usually four spaces or one tab.


iii) if ...elif ...else statement 
> This has three option to  be considerd that is (if) ,(elif) and (else) .
>if the condition statement on if header (if ) , then the (elif) is considered also if 
the conndition is false now the default (else) part is considered

if condition:
  block of statement 

elif condition:
 block of statement 

 
 else: 
    block statement 
     
iv) Nest if statement 
>this is multiple if statement stacked inside each other and evaluation happens 
in the order inwhich they are stacked.
>In situation one (if) block is false ,its (else) counterpart is evaluated and statement under it is displayed.

If condition :
   statement block 

   if condition :
    statement block 

   if condition:
     statement block


      else:
        statement block 
           

else:
     statement block


v) Ternary operators/conditional expression
- Looks like its a short in-line version of an if statement.
- Used usually when you want to choose between two values, depending on some condition
It makes it easier & more readable to use the ternary instead of a full if statement
- Example:
            order_total = 247

            # classic if/else form
            if order_total > 100:
              discount = 25

            else:
              discount = 0

            print(order_total, discount)

            # ternary version
            discount = 25 if order_total > 100 else 0
            print(order_total, discount)

    if age >= 18:
        status = "Adult"
    else:
        status = "Minor"

    # You write THIS:
    status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"

vi) match statement
- the match statement compares a value against one or more patterns, and then it 
executes the code block associated with the first pattern that matches

# match statement
working_days = 9

match working_days:
    case 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5:
        print("That is a working day")
    
    case 6:
        print("That is a Weekend")

    case 7:
        print("That is a day you choose what to do")

    case _:
        print("That is not a valid day number")
