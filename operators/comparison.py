y = 1
z = 15

# egual to ==
print(y==z) # is y equal to z ? answer (True or False)

# not equal to !=
print(y!=z)# is y not  equal to z ? answer (True or False)

# greater than >
print(y>z)# is y greater than  z ? answer (True or False)

# less than < 
print(y<z) # is y less than z?  answer(True or False)

# greater than equal to >=
print(y >= z) # is y greater than or equal to z? answer (true or false)

# less than equal to <=
print( y<= z ) # is y less than or equal to z ? answer (true or false)
