OPERATORS
>Operators are symbols, such as+,-,=,< and > that perform certain mathematical or 
 logical operation to manipulate data values and produce a result based on some rules. 
>They assist in arithmetic and logical operation on values
>An operator manipulates the data values called operands
example:
        4+6
        -here 4 and 6 are operanders
        -operanders can be variable name also 
        Example:
            t=6
            u=7
            total=t+u 
            as you can see t and u are operandersand + is the Operators.
    = is an operator  

a)arithmetics operanders
Aarithmetic operator are used to execut arithmetic operations such as addition  ,subtraction
,division,multiplication
+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
// floor division
** exponention
%    modulus


b)comparison operators 
-When the vaalue of two operands are to be compared then comparison operators are used.
-The output of this comparison operators is always Boolean values,either True or false
The operands can be Numbers or Strings or Boolean values. Strings are compared letters 
by letter using their ASCII values ,thus, "p" is less than "Q" ,"As" is greater than "asher.
 
> greater than 
< less than 
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to
!= not equal to 
== egual to

c) Logical operators 
- they are used for comparing or negating the logic values of their operands
and to return the resulting logical value.
-The values of an operands on which the logical operators operate evaluate to either True or False.
-The result of the logical operator is always a Boolean value ,True or false

 and operators
 or operators
 not operators

 d)Assignment operators 
  This is a symbol of assigment operators "="

We have to command assignment where assigment operators are 
  combined with arithmetic operators:
  += addition assignment
  -= subtraction assignment
  *= multiplication assignment
  /= division  assignment
  %= modulus  assignment
  //=floor division assignment
  **=exponention assignment
