a)f-strings
>The "f" strings is flexed inside the print() statment bracket,followed by speach marks.
>The variables is enclosed in the current bracket{}.
>An "f" at the begining of the string tells python to allow any currently valid variable
 names within the string.
 >The syntax include:
     print(f"{}")
     print(f"{variable_name}")
     In the above the variable is placed inside the curly backets to prevent 
     it from being converted to strings
b)str.format()
>The syntax:
   print("{0},{1}".format (variable_one,variable_two))
   Here 0, 1 are indexes.Indexes usually start from 0.In this example ,the variables 
   will be replaced in the specified indexes,that is variable_one will replace index 0 and 
   variable_two will replace index 1
