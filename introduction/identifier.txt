IDENTIFIYER
>It is a name you guese that is use in naming things in python
  e.g Variables names ,user defined functions ,class names 
  >it is used as an adress for memory location.
  >In oder to creat variable identifier the following rules must be followed.
>Rules for naming identifier:

a)Identifier can be combination of letters (A-Z,digits0-9, underscore).
Exeption:
    i)You can not begin with a digit but the digit can be at the end.
    90total      total90
    ii)Underscore can begin and also applied between two words 
    _results       total_results       total _ marks _ 2024 total_marks  
    Iii)space between two or three words is not allowed.
    Example:  
    total_marks >wrong 
    total_marks >correct

b)Identifier names should be meaningful, relating to what you are coding.
c)Special symbols cannot be part of an identifier.
Example:@ $ % ! ^ & * () =
total@
$_result
!marks
d)Identifier can be small or small individual letter of alphabet.
Example: A or a 
tm
total_marks
e)Reserved words
   -This ate words with special meanig in pythonidentifier, they cannot be used individually
   as identifiers,instead combine with another word.
   print,input,if,else,for,while,true,false,and or not.

   Task: Creat 10 identifiers of your choise.

VARIABLES   
>It is adressed to a memmory location.
>It is used to retreve values from  the memmory location

>Three items are needed
1.valid identifier
2.assignment operator (=)
3.value-number ,string

Syntax
    valid identifie= values
    a) valid _ identifier 
      represent the valid name you have created following the
       rules for naming identifier
    b)assignmentoprator (=)  
    I is used to take values from the right and store on the 
    storage location represent by the address (valid _ identifier )
    on the left.
Retreve values
>To represent values from memmory location we use
print()funtion which acts as a messenger that retrieve
values from memory locationwhose addressis the variable name 
The Syntax:
     print(variable_name)
total=100

print(total)
