READING INPUT
>I in python input () funstion is used to take data from user when the program is running
>There are several ways of initializing variables or assigning values  to variables
a)When program is not running (static initialization)
>To initialize the variables with vales when the program is not running 
we use the assigmant operator (=)
Example:   total= 100

b)When the program is running (dynamic initialization)
>To initialize the program when the program is running we use the imput () function
Example:
     variable _name = input ("prompt")

>The "prompt?" statement is what is displayed in on the screen indicating to the user a value needs to be entered through the keyboard.
>After the user enters a value and press enter key ,the value is extracted and stored in the address represented br the variable-NAME .
>The value is treated as a string automatically by default.
>Some of ways to forse the value entered from being traeted as a certain type.
we use a technique called - typecasting

Type casting 
>This is forsing values to be converrted to a different data type 
>Type casting is divided into two typecasting
a) implicit -the interpreter does the conversion
    Example:
    t=10.5
    r=7+10.5
    here which is an interger will  be converted to floating point value for addition.

    b)explicit - you do the conversion mernualy.
    >We use the following typecast function:
    input() converts value to integer.
    float()converts values to decimal figures.

    with input() function.
